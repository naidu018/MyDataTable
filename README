DataTable Client Side Implementation:

==========================================================================================================================================

Datatable is a jQuery plugin which gives a nice userInterface for the table in html. It has several modes of implementation. 
= Client Side
= Server Side.

In the client side, datatable extracts the data from the client side. There will not be any interaction with the database. 
The data can be defined in the html form itself or other files.
I have used a serverSide request using ajax to extract the data and populate the table. The next step would to make an ajax request to 
a .php file that connects to a database and retrives the data and that data is captured through the ajax request and rendered on the user interface.
